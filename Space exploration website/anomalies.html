        <p class="text-center text-lg mb-10">
            Space anomalies refer to unexpected or unexplained phenomena observed in space, which challenge our understanding of the universe and often prompt new theories or scientific investigations. These anomalies can occur in various forms, from gravitational and magnetic irregularities to strange cosmic events that defy current models of physics. Here‚Äôs an overview of the different types of space anomalies:

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2" style="color: #F6FF4C;">Gravitational Anomalies</h3>
                    <p>Gravitational anomalies refer to unexpected variations in the gravitational field of a region in space. These can occur due to the presence of unknown or invisible mass distributions, like dark matter or large cosmic structures that we don't fully understand. For instance, in certain regions of space, gravitational forces appear stronger or weaker than expected, which can affect the orbits of planets or satellites. One of the most famous gravitational anomalies is the "Pioneer Anomaly," where spacecraft traveling through deep space seemed to deviate from their expected trajectory, likely due to unexplained forces or spacecraft thermal emissions.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2" style="color: #F6FF4C;">Magnetic Anomalies</h3>
                    <p>Magnetic anomalies in space occur when magnetic fields deviate from expected patterns. These anomalies can arise from several sources, including the magnetic fields of planets, stars, or even entire galaxies. For example, Earth's magnetic field experiences local anomalies, where it is stronger or weaker than expected. Similarly, space probes like the Voyager spacecraft have detected unexpected magnetic fluctuations in interstellar space, suggesting the presence of unknown magnetic forces or interactions. These anomalies could be linked to dark matter or the cosmic magnetic field, which remains poorly understood.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2" style="color: #F6FF4C;">Temporal Anomalies</h3>
                    <p>Temporal anomalies refer to discrepancies in the passage of time, often observed in the context of relativistic effects predicted by Einstein's theories of relativity. In space, these anomalies can appear when time seems to slow down or speed up, particularly near massive objects or in areas with strong gravitational fields, like black holes or neutron stars. For instance, time appears to slow down in the intense gravity near a black hole, an effect known as gravitational time dilation. Temporal anomalies can also arise in deep space travel, where spacecraft at high velocities may experience time differently compared to observers on Earth, due to relativistic effects.</p>

                    <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the residual radiation from the Big Bang, and its study provides essential insights into the early universe. However, certain anomalies in the CMB have puzzled cosmologists. One of the most famous is the "Cold Spot," a large, unusually cold region in the CMB, which could suggest the influence of a large-scale structure in the universe or even a potential interaction with another universe (multiverse theory). Other CMB anomalies include the "axis of evil," which refers to an alignment of certain features in the CMB that seem to be oriented in a way that defies expectations based on random, isotropic fluctuations. These anomalies are still under investigation</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2" style="color: #F6FF4C;">Dark Matter Anomalies</h3>
                    <p>Dark matter anomalies refer to unusual observations or behavior that might indicate the presence or nature of dark matter. Dark matter, which accounts for roughly 85% of the mass in the universe, does not emit light or energy, making it difficult to detect. However, its presence is inferred by its gravitational effects on visible matter. One anomaly related to dark matter is the unexpected rotation curves of galaxies. The stars in galaxies move at speeds that suggest there should be more mass than we can see, hinting at the existence of dark matter. Recent observations, such as the gravitational lensing effects seen in galaxy clusters, provide further clues to dark matter's mysterious role in the cosmos.</p>

                    <p>Stellar anomalies refer to unusual or unexplained behaviors observed in stars or star systems. These can include unexpected variations in a star‚Äôs brightness, unusual stellar explosions, or atypical chemical compositions. One example is the mystery of "fast radio bursts" (FRBs), which are brief, intense flashes of radio energy from distant galaxies. The origin of these bursts remains unclear, and they have been hypothesized to originate from highly magnetized neutron stars or even exotic phenomena like the collision of black holes. Another example is the phenomenon of "rogue stars"‚Äîstars that appear to be moving through space without being bound to any galaxy or star system, suggesting unusual interactions or cosmic events that are not fully understood.</p>
